# Perfect Pair

## User Story

As a user I am looking to find drink and meal recipes.

## Project Description

Everyone loves a delicious meal and cocktail to have on any occasion. From a stressful Thursday evening of work to a relaxing Sunday brunch, we hope to make your cooking and mixing experience as easy and tasty as possible. When you visit Perfect Pair you can expect to find the perfect perusing experience. Our thoughtful layout allows one to search for meals or drinks by ingredient type showing a plethora of thoughtfully curated recipes to take your dining experience to the next level. Perfect Pair also allows for you to add favorites and save the most enticing recipes, making it easier to revisit an old favorite or something you want to make in the future.

For this product we used JavaScript, CSS and HTML as our backbone. We also leveraged bootstrap, jQuery, and jQuery UI as libraries to assist with the functionality and style of the product. Everything is hosted and deployed in Github for easy access to future contributors of the project. We chose bootstrap for some out of the box design elements and its ease of use. We leveraged jQuery to make it the code cleaner with how much DOM manipulation we needed to achieve. We leveraged the mealdb and cocktaildb APIs because of the robust information the provided.

Some of the Challenges we faced were deciding on a UI that functioned seamlessly with our APIs, Creating a design that would allow the user to see the recipes from the main page without overwhelming their experience, and deciding how best to leverage the APIs

## Acceptance Criteria

When: I search for a type of food or drink.
Then: multiple recipes come up.
When: When I favorite a recipe
Then: it is saved to my favorite folder.
When: I leave an input blank
Then: a modal pops up to recommend you add a drink or food to pair with it.
When: When I click my favorites
Then: a separate page shows my saved recipe’s

## Install

You will need to leverage bootstrap library: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.cs

## How to use

I have attached photos below that outline different aspects of the product.
To select an ingredient item simply start typing and choose one of the listed items. Once selected you will see meals populated in the carosel and drinks below. When a recipie looks enticing click the see recipie button to view the details in a modal. If you would like to save that recipie for later click the favorite button. You can find your saved recipies at the bottom of the page
